params.txt			Parameters file needed to run the python scripts in _this_ directory.


This directory includes data for one training episode, Episode4, and three
testing episodes, Episode6, Episode10, and Episode18.

The training and testing data comprises, for each episode:

a) A directory with log files generated by the simulation; these are only needed
   to run an episode python script to visualise the episode.

b) A python script to visualise an episode's environment by running the
   simulation in that environment. Note that Episode4, Episode6 and Episode10
   need Map2.png to be chosen in params.txt (set map_n: to 2) whereas
   Episode18 needs Map1.png to be chosen (set map_n: to 1).

c) One or more map images, to visualise different configurations of the map for
   that episode. There is one map for Episode18, Map1.png. The other maps are
   for Episode4, Episode6 and Episode10. The maps for those episodes include
   Map2_free.png, which has no obstructions, and Map2_obs_*.png maps that have
   an island obstructing the boat's progress (so that we can test obstacle
   avoidance). In each of the Map2_obs*.png has the island in a different
   position, generally to the west, middle or west of the map and with some
   variation to the south or north. The names of the map files should explain
   that, for example Map2_obs_east_north.png has an island to the east of the
   map and a bit to the north, etc.

d) One occlusion grid for each map image described in (c). The occlusion grids
   named after the map images for easy identification, e.g.
   occ_grid_east_south.pl is the occlusion grid file for the map image
   Map2_obs_east_south.png etc. The occlusion grid files are prolog files that
   will probably have to be converted into a different notation, useable by
   Python.

e) params.txt, a parameters file that's needed to run the python scripts to
  visualise each episode in the simulation.


Of all this, the files you probably need the most are the occlusion grids,
because they have the maps of 1's and 0's that determine passability of terrain
(1 is land, and unpassable, 0 is water and passable).
